# Andriod-Coursework

- This is the CW of the mobile module were you are excepted to make a game which players will be using to practice their
arithmetic calculative skills.

Key poits 
1 - Clicking on the New Game button, the user will be presented with the game screen which
they interact with. The screen displays 2 random arithmetic expressions one on the left and one on the right
and 3 buttons below them. Each of the 2 arithmetic expressions involves 1, 2, 3 or 4 terms and it should be random
(i.e. not hardcoded, or fixed, neither for the terms nor for the operations). Every time the game screen reappears, the user is displayed with 2 new different arithmetic expressions.
The 2 arithmetic expressions could be of different lengths, e.g. the left could have 2 terms
and the right one 3 terms. The next time that a new game screen appears to the user the
left expression might involve 4 terms and the right expression 2 terms.
The operations allowed between terms are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*)
and division (/).
The range of the random numbers (the random numbers are generated dynamically based
on a a random generator) should be in the between 1 and 20 inclusive.
Both the terms and the operations must be random and different every time
that the user is presented with a new game screen.

2 -  The user needs to indicate whether the evaluation of the expression on the left is greater
than, equal or less than the evaluation of the right expression, by pressing the buttons
Greater, == or Less respectively.
The order of evaluation is always left to right and this is indicated by “compulsory”
parentheses if the arithmetic expression involves more than 2 terms (i.e. 3 or 4 terms).
An expression with 1 or 2 terms should NOT have any parentheses.
Examples of valid arithmetic expressions are:
2*3
(6+4)/2
((10-2)*3)/4
Examples of invalid arithmetic expressions are:
(2*3) no parentheses for 2 terms, i.e. should be 2*3
6+(4/2) parentheses should be placed from left to right, i.e. should be (6+4)/2
(10-2)*3/4 parentheses are missing, i.e. should be ((10-2)*3)/4
As soon as the user submits the answer, the message CORRECT! (in green colour) or the
message WRONG! (in red colour) appears on the screen.
